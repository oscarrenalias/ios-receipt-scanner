## Roadmap features

- Pre-processing of image to apply basic edits to improve quality
- Automatic identification, when possible, of edges of the receipt/document (using Apple's Vision Framework, for example)

## Image edge detection

Leverage Apple's Vision Framework to identify edges on the screen with the shape of the document that has been scanned. If no edges can be found then use the default 80% of the rectange as in the current implementation. This functionality should be triggered when opening the Crop functionality, but the screen should show an overlay saying "Processing..." in case the operation takes too long. When the operation is complete, the overlay should disappear and the cropping rectangle should appear either in its default position or according to the edges identified by the Vision framework call.
