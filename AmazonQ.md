# Receipt Scanner App - Code Cleanup

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified the project structure:**
   - Removed redundant image editor implementations
   - Consolidated cropping functionality into a single implementation
   - Eliminated conflicting view names
   - Completely removed old files (no compatibility wrappers)

2. **Retained the most recent implementation with improved features:**
   - `EnhancedImageEditorView.swift` - Main image editor with all features
   - `ImageCropView.swift` - Dedicated cropping functionality
   - Removed old `ImageEditorView.swift` and `SimpleCropView.swift` files

3. **Added zoom functionality to both views:**
   - Added pinch-to-zoom in the main image editor view
   - Added pinch-to-zoom in the crop view
   - Added double-tap gesture to toggle between zoomed in/out states
   - Created a reusable `ZoomableImageView` component

4. **Improved UI elements:**
   - Added an "X" close button to dismiss the editor
   - Styled the close button with a circular background
   - Ensured proper navigation flow between views
   - Added instructional text "Tap image to edit and save" below the image
   - Added padding to move the image down from the top of the screen
   - Kept the image visible after editing for further modifications
   - Fixed screen flashing during image processing with a single, centered progress indicator

5. **Fixed cropping functionality:**
   - Added proper zoom support with pinch and double-tap gestures
   - Fixed initial zoom level to show the entire image
   - Improved crop rectangle calculation
   - Fixed dismissal after cropping
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

6. **Added debugging print statements:**
   - Added strategic print statements to track execution flow
   - Improved logging for cropping operations
   - Added navigation tracking

7. **Fixed sheet presentation issues:**
   - Ensured proper sheet presentation for the crop view
   - Added print statements to verify sheet presentation
   - Improved transition animations between views

8. **Improved code organization:**
   - Simplified class structure
   - Removed duplicate functionality
   - Maintained all features from the original implementation
   - Added processing guards to prevent multiple simultaneous image updates

9. **Fixed build errors:**
   - Updated ScannerView to use EnhancedImageEditorView directly
   - Removed all references to old implementations
   - Fixed missing closing braces in struct definitions

## File Structure

- `EnhancedImageEditorView.swift` - Main image editor with all features
- `ImageCropView.swift` - Dedicated cropping functionality
- `ZoomableImageView.swift` - Reusable component for zoomable images
- `ContentView.swift` - Main app entry point (modified to use EnhancedImageEditorView)
- `ScannerView.swift` - Scanner functionality (updated to use EnhancedImageEditorView)

## Usage

The app now uses a single, consistent image editing flow:

1. Capture or select an image
2. Edit with EnhancedImageEditorView (with zoom capability)
3. Use ImageCropView for cropping when needed (with zoom capability)
4. Save or share the processed image
5. Return to the scanner view with the image still visible for further editing

All functionality remains the same, but with a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with improved user guidance and smoother image processing experience.
